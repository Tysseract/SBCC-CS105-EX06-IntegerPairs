## Exercise: IntegerPairs (12 Points)

The project name of this exercise is **IntegerPairs**.

The purpose of this assignment is to apply what you have learned about decisions with `if` statements, compound `if` statements and multiple alternatives

### Problem Description

The detailed description of this problem comes from the Programming Exercise P5.7 that is in the book (page 228).

You are to write a program that will take one string of four positive integers (e.g. "0 1 1 2") and will test to see if there are two pairs present in the string. 

Hints:

- After you are done with the scanner be sure to call {your scanner variable name}.close();

- Don't be afraid to make local variables. You can use them to hold the numbers you get from the string.

This problem should be solved by writing all your code in `public static void main`. You will want to implement the algorithm inside of the `main` method. 

Using the test input, your output should look like:

`Enter four numbers: 1 2 2 2 not two pairs`

### Getting Started

Like our last exercise, we are going to do this exercise by writing the source code that solves the problem first in **Main.java**. Using the techniques shown on the web page titled [How to Start Every Project in this Class](https://github.com/sbcc-cs105-spring2016/HowToStartEveryProject) create a source file called **Main.java**. This is where your code will go. Replace the code in that file with the code in the grey box below:

```java
package edu.sbcc.cs105;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

}
```

Now go through Main.java, add the proper headers as in past assighments and then change the [CHANGE THIS TO YOUR INFORMATION] text to the proper items. There are two items to be changed.

For your code get a number from the user using the `Scanner` class as in past assignments, then output the words `negative`, `positive` or `zero` only. The unit test will test for exactly these words.

Once you've written your code run the code by single clicking on **Main.java** in the package explorer and selecting **Run->Run** from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut. Examine the output. Does it do what you want? If not, how can you modify the code to do what you want?

###Running the Unit Tests

Next you'll want to run these unit tests. Start by right-clicking on the `unittest.cs105` package and selecting **Run As -> JUnit Test**. 

Once you have run the tests, the results of them should look something like the following:

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/79zw4fbsjebbx1s/junit_test.png?dl=1" width="257" height="445" />

To go back to the project view, select the **Package Explorer** tab.

### How to turn in this exercise

The first step of turning in your code is to commit and push your code to GitHub. Once you've completed this step your code will be on GitHub in your repository, not the repository for the class. This will allow you to use all your projects later as a portfolio.

To start the process write click your project and select **Team -> Commit...**. 

Now follow these steps to commit and push your code:

1. Select the files by check marking the files you want to commit. In this case **Main.java**. 
2. Enter a commit message. The commit message can be anything, but should describe the changes that are begin committed. A good commit message in this case might be "Committing code to check in for assignment"
3. Press **Commit and Push**

You will see a few more dialogs (including ones that may ask for your GitHub username and password) go by:

1. Push **OK** to complete the commit. You may get no confirmation, but you can check GitHub to see if the code now exists there.

####Completing the turn-in process

Now to complete the turn-in process, once you confirmed that your code is on GitHub, you need to create a **pull request** against the class GitHub repository. This action will indicate to the original project that you have finished your coding and it will create a place to give feedback on a line by line basis. 

Go to **your** repository for this assignment on GitHub and click on the **Pull Request** icon.
 
1\. Click on **New pull request**

The next screen then shows all or your commits up to this point.  It shows the difference between what you originally forked with what you have committed. This difference, often called a "diff", is what your turning in and what I will be grading. 

2\. Click on **Create pull request**

This final action "_turns_" in the assignment on GitHub. It also causes your code to be unit tested on a separate server. The result should be exactly the same as when you ran it on your computer.

After grading the exercise, the pull request will be closed without merging back into the original project. This is the normal workflow and does not represent any problem with your code.

Finally, you should receive an email that has links to both the pull request and the results of running your code.

**NOTE** You do not need to anything on Moodle to turn-in your assignment, but your grade will be posted on there so that you mab track your progress throughout the term.
